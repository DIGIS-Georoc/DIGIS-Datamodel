# DIGIS-Datamodel
The datamodel of the GEOROC 2.0 database in the DIGIS project. Based on ODM2.

An overview of the schema can be found in the GEOROC2ODM2_jun_8_2022.png.

## Setup
You can generate the datamodel by running the SQL script located in `/sql_scripts`.
Note that this script is written for PostgreSQL database - if you want to use a different database, you will have to adapt the script to your specific SQL dialect.
